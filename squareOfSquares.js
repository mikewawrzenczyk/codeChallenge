/*A square of squares

You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
Task

Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

    In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.
Examples

-1  =>  false
 0  =>  true
 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true
25  =>  true
26  =>  false

var isSquare = function(n){
    //P: integer given, determine if its a square number by finding square root of the number if it is a whole integer that number is a perfect square.
    //Result: return true or false
    return n >=0 && Number.isInteger(Math.sqrt(n))
    //return statement with implicit return making sure the number is 0 or above AKA positive and if it is an integer after being square rooted.

console.log(isSquare(-1), false, "-1: Negative numbers cannot be square numbers");
console.log(isSquare( 0), true, "0 is a square number (0 * 0)");
console.log(isSquare( 3), false, "3 is not a square number");
console.log(isSquare( 4), true, "4 is a square number (2 * 2)");
console.log(isSquare(25), true, "25 is a square number (5 * 5)");
console.log(isSquare(26), false, "26 is not a square number");
