/*
Our football team finished the championship. The result of each match look like "x:y". Results of all matches are recorded in the collection.

For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

Write a function that takes such collection and counts the points of our team in the championship. Rules for counting points for each match:

    if x > y: 3 points
    if x < y: 0 point
    if x = y: 1 point

Notes:

    there are 10 matches in the championship
    0 <= x <= 4
    0 <= y <= 4
